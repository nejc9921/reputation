"""
Any Agent
	May be supplier or consumer
		First fraction is "suppliers" 0.0-1.0
		Last fraction is "consumers" 0.0-1.0
		Overlapping fraction is "suppliers-consumers", eg. if the above fractions are 0.55 each then we have 0.1 suppliers-consumers
Simple Good Agent
	If bad rating is done to another agent, it is unlikely new order will be done to the same agent again
	May spend large amounts of funds per tasks
	Consumption (ordering patterns) are natural
	Received ratings may be either good or bad, with some sort of consistency of ratings received from different good agents in the same period of time
	The more an agent is satisfied with a supplier, the more likely that agent is to stay with the same supplier, and the less satisfied an agent is with a supplier, the more likely they are to look elsewhere.  However, there is always a small chance of changing suppliers to represent unmodeled reasons, like moving, etc.
	Prices are similar for similar goods and services, but not the same, with normal distributions 
	Agents purchase goods and services that they need more before they purchase those goods and services they need less
	Agents have varying but similar needs for goods in services, normally distributed.
	Agents rate 1 for goodness in the top 25%, 0 for goodness in the bottom 25% and 0.5 is applied to all others.  However, each has a bias in its perception of goodness, that could move the underlying score and result in different categorizations
	Good agent ratings are more consistent than fake good ratings of bad agents by bad agents.
	Suppliers are also consumers.
	Agents try out new services randomly (in the absence of a reputation model)
Simple Bad Agent (Cheater/Scammer)
	Donâ€™t spend money making bad ratings
	Makes good ratings to collaborating bad agents
	Unlikely spends large amounts of funds on fake tasks needed for ratings ratings 
	Consumption (ordering patterns) are unlikely natural
	Never get good ratings from good agents
	Has a consistent group of other bad agents that positive ratings are reciprocated
	There are often many fake accounts per one bad actor, that are likely to have the same behavior patterns and reciprocities.  These accounts could have transaction per day numbers closer to normal agent transactions, but there are more of them.
